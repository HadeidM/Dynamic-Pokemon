# Dynamic Pokemon

I created a simple dynamic webpage using **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS** that loads 898 pokemon icons from a sprite [repo](https://github.com/PokeAPI/sprites) on GitHub.

The webpage is live on: [https://hadeidm.github.io/DynamicPokemon/](https://hadeidm.github.io/DynamicPokemon/), **check it out!**

Reach out to me if you liked the project or have any suggestions to improve it! :grinning:
